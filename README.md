Once all files are saved and committed → refresh your site:  
🔗 **https://frankherb1985.github.io/aurelios/**  
You’ll now see the **final AureliOS gold-black UI**.

Would you like me to include a **lightweight stats.js** next (to display daily PnL % and streak counter)? It can be added instantly and cached into the same service worker.
